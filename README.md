## Assignment Overview

This...is going to be an ego-fest. You're going to design a site that's all about...**you**! This...really is a project. But, we like having a *single* project per module, so here we are. This 'assignment' is going to take a bit of time. As you'll see below, there's a number of deliverables. However, once you've completed this assignment, you'll have done *all* the work (individuallY) that goes into designing the first iteration of a website!

What should this site focus on? Well, braodly, you. It's really up to what you want to tell your class/teacher/the world about. Eventually, you'll develop a working version of this design, but - for now - let's just focus on designing something that reflects who *you* are.

## Deliverables 

 - [ ] Mind map <br />
 - [ ] A site map of what your entire site will look like <br />
 - [ ] A high-fidelity mock-up of your site
 - [ ] Flipgrid (if your teacher is into that SaaS) reflection wherein you share your screen and talk us through your site's design system/the prototype
